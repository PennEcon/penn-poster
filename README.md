# Sample template for making a Penn-branded poster

1. `beamerposter.sty` contains the `beamerposter` package, copyright 2007 by Philippe Dreuw.
2. `beamerthemeconfposter.sty` is a beamer theme with Penn colors and some modifications by me.
3. `penn.eps` is a print-quality Penn logo.
4. `poster.tex` contains an example tex file showing how to use the package. Build it normally,
  ```
  pdflatex poster.tex
  ```

Bibliography, equation references, etc., all seem to work normally (or as they would in a beamer presentation) here.
